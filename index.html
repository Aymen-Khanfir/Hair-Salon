        <p class="know-more2">
          Of course, National Hair Day doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s necessary to go to extremes. Even those who aren&apos;t ready for a new cut or color might be able to play around with their hair a bit on this day. Maybe start by making the part of your hair on the other side!

          This is also a great time to learn a new skill that is related to hair styling. Perhaps that might be learning how to make a regular braid, a French braid or a Fishtail Braid. YouTube and other online videos can act as an excellent resource for learning with easy, step by step tutorials on how to create a new hairstyle.
